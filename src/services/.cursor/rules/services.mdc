This is the place where we have all our services.

Services don't need to maintain state, but they _must_ yield side effects.

At the time of writing this, even a GET request is a side effect, because it is invoking a third-party service via HTTP, which is beyond the scope of _necessary_ side effects to maintain atomic, idempotent, effectless black-box invocations.
