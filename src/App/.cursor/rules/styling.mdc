When creating components, please be sure to support dark mode, using Tailwind's `dark` variants.

Additionally, in the folder above `App`, I have defined a custom set of color/hue and shades in the Tailwind themes. We're using Tailwind, so definitely use utility classes that uses the colours defined there for the `dark` variants.

For example:

```
<span className="text-gray-500 dark:text-logseq-cyan-low-saturation-400"></span>
```
