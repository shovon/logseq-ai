On the left, there’s a sidebar showing sections such as Journals, Whiteboards, Flashcards, Graph view, and All pages. The main pane displays a journal entry dated Nov 23rd, 2025, containing bullet-point notes about commit counts, GitHub links, and progress on refactoring a task runner. On the right side of the screen, a chat interface shows a conversation where the user asks about the number of commits and the repository URL, and the assistant replies with information pulled from the notes." src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/48a19449-bdea-482e-8177-853f09e7defb" />
